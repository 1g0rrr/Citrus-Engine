The [Citrus Engine](http://citrusengine.com/) is a professional-grade, scalable Flash game engine built for industry-quality games. It is built upon modern Flash programming practices, allowing you to focus on making your game awesome! It comes built-in with a "platformer" starter-kit, which you can use to easily make awesome 2D sidescrolling games.

It offers many options, you may use :
- the classic flash display list, or blitting or Stage3D thanks to [Starling](http://gamua.com/starling/).
- [Box2D](http://www.box2d.org/manual.html), or [Nape](http://deltaluca.me.uk/docnew/) or a Simple math based collision detection.
- a simple way to manage object creation, and for advanced developers : an entity/component system and object pooling.
- a LevelManager and LoadManager which may use Flash Pro as a level editor.
