The [Citrus Engine](http://citrusengine.com/) is a professional-grade, scalable Flash game engine built for industry-quality games. It is built upon modern Flash programming practices, allowing you to focus on making your game awesome! It comes built-in with a "platformer" starter-kit, which you can use to easily make awesome 2D sidescrolling games.

The [Citrus Engine](http://citrusengine.com/) is not only made for 2D platformer games, but for all type of 2D games. It offers a nice way to separate logic/physics from art.

It offers many options, you may use :
- the classic flash display list, or blitting or Stage3D thanks to [Starling](http://gamua.com/starling/).
- [Box2D](http://www.box2d.org/manual.html), or [Nape](http://deltaluca.me.uk/docnew/) or a Simple math based collision detection.
- a simple way to manage object creation, and for advanced developers : an entity/component system and object pooling.
- a LevelManager and LoadManager which may use Flash Pro as a level editor.

Project Setup
-------------
- bin : pictures, animations, levels, ... loaded at runtime.
- embed : embedded assets (e.g. fonts, pictures, texture atlas, ...).
- fla : two levels used in the box2dstarling demo, and two animate characters in two versions one for SpriteArt and one for StarlingArt thanks to the DynamicTextureAtlas class (loaded at runtime).
- libs : all the libs used, included the Citrus Engine. Select just one Nape swc.
- src : different demos ready to use! You just need to copy & paste the Main from the package you want into the src/Main.as and the demo will run. Be careful with package & import.
